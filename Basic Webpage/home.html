                <p>Google Search is a search engine provided and operated by Google. Handling more than 3.5 billion searches per
                    day, it has a 92% share of the global search engine market. It is the most-visited website in the world.
                    Additionally, it is the most searched and used search engine in the entire world.<br/>

                Each new generation of Google's Pixel A-series phones comes with fewer compromises than the last. That's truer than ever
            with the Pixel 7A, which costs $499 and bears striking similarity to the $599 Pixel 7. After reviewing both phones, I'm
            convinced the Pixel 7A is the best value for most people. Both phones run on Google's Tensor G2 processor, meaning you'll get
            essentially the same performance and very similar photography and language translation features on both devices.The biggest
            area in which they differ on paper comes down to their cameras and their size, although in practice I could barely tell the
            difference between photos taken on both devices.<br/>

                <header><h2><u>Bill Gates talks about the future of AI and its impact on Big Tech</Article></u></h2></header>
                <p>Microsoft co-founder and one of the wealthiest men on the planet Bill Gates has talked about AI and how it can reshape customer behavior. Speaking at the
                Goldman Sachs and SV Angel event, Gates alluded to the capability of AI to challenge Big Tech companies like Google and Amazon.<br/>
    
                Gates predicted that the top AI company in the future would be a company that could build a personal agent to perform tasks for people. He added that AI could
                “radically” change user behaviors. For example, users do not need to visit a website or shop in an online store anymore.<br/>
                
                “Whoever wins the personal agent, that is the big thing because you will never go to a search site again, you will never go to a productivity site, you will never
                go to Amazon again,” Gates said.<br/>
